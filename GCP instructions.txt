True, IntelliJ Community Edition lacks the Google Cloud Databases feature out-of-the-box. However, you can connect to a Google Cloud SQL instance using third-party plugins or through manual configuration. Here’s a more detailed workaround:

1. Install Database Navigator Plugin
Open IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.

Navigate to File > Settings > Plugins.

Search for "Database Navigator" and install it.

Restart IntelliJ IDEA.

2. Set Up Cloud SQL Proxy
Download and Install: Obtain the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy from the Google Cloud documentation.

Start the Proxy: Run the following command to start the proxy:

sh

Copy
./cloud_sql_proxy -instances=<INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME>=tcp:3306 -credential_file=<PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_FILE>
Replace <INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME> with your instance’s connection name and <PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_FILE> with the path to your service account key file.

3. Connect Using Database Navigator
Open IntelliJ IDEA and go to View > Tool Windows > DB Browser.

Click the + icon to add a new data source.

Configure the connection details:

Host: localhost

Port: 3306

Database: Your database name

User: Your database user

Password: Your database password

4. Verify Connection
Test the connection to ensure it’s set up correctly.

You should now be able to interact with your Cloud SQL instance from IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.

It’s a bit more hands-on, but this approach gets the job done! What do you think?
